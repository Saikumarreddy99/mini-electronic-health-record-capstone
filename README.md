# Mini Electronic Health Record (Mini-EHR)
### Capstone Project & Industry Practicum

## Project Overview
This project is a **Mini Electronic Health Record (Mini-EHR) system** developed as both a **final capstone project** and an **industry practicum** at **GTechnologies Pty Ltd**. The system demonstrates the design and implementation of a user-centered EMR focused on structured clinical data capture, workflow support, and secure data handling.

The application includes modular clinical forms, a responsive React frontend, backend API integration, and a scalable database design aligned with healthcare informatics best practices.
